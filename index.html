                <p>Born in Helsinki, Finland, on 28 of december of 1969, in a communist family, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">Linus Torvalds</a> is one fundamental piece of the puzzle of the big personalities of the free software, and computer science in general.
                He carried forward the programming of a <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%BAcleo_(inform%C3%A1tica)#:~:text=En%20inform%C3%A1tica%2C%20un%20n%C3%BAcleo%20o,conocido%20tambi%C3%A9n%20como%20modo%20n%C3%BAcleo)." target="_BLANK">Kernel</a> (core of an operative system), when the GNU free operative system started by <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman" target="_BLANK">Richard Stallman</a> was far of obtaining a core, at the early 90's some people took the Linux kernel of Torvalds and put it togther with other pieces that were being developed by the the Free Software Linux, and thats how GNU/Linux was born.
                To achieve the core, Linus was based in "Design of the unix operating system", witch he could modify the kernel, of other operative system called, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINIX" target="_BLANK">Minix</a> for creating this adaptation that could execute the aplications of the GNU system on IBM/PC computers.
                His programming experience is as follows: as an student of the Helsinki University, he started programming in C, but for 5 years he was programming on other languages. And he got colse to his first computer on 1980
                On 5th of October of 1991, he publicly announced that his kernel could execute the GCC compiler and BASH, 2 fundamental stones of free software.
                Other fundamental momnet in Linus's and Linux's life was the adoption of general public license in 1992, with witch it turned into free software, and thats what made it possible for study, modification, use, and improvement until our days.
                In 1997, he finished gis university studies, then he worked on transmeta until 2003, and actually he is doing working at the "Open Source Development Labs", located in Beaverton, Oregon, EE.UU</p>
